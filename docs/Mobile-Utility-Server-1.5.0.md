# Migration from 1.4.x to 1.5.0

This guide provides instructions for migrating from PowerAuth Mobile Utility Server version `1.4.x` to version `1.5.0`.

No migration steps nor database changes are required.

Please note, due to a backport to the version `1.4.x` database migration to `1.5.x` was shifted and described in the
[guideline](./Mobile-Utility-Server-1.4.0.md).
If you are migrating from `1.4.x` there is no other migration needed. If you are migrating from `1.1.x` you need to perform
migration steps to `1.4.x` first.
